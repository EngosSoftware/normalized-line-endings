## Overview

The **Normalized Line Endings** crate provides an iterator over characters
with normalized line endings, meaning all valid line endings in the input
are converted to a single newline character: `\n` (U+000A).

For example:
- `\n` â†’ `\n`
- `\r` â†’ `\n`
- `\r\n` â†’ `\n`
 
The normalized iterator can be created using standalone function `normalized`
or by calling the method `normalized` on any iterator over characters.

This work was inspired by [normalize-line-endings](https://crates.io/crates/normalize-line-endings) crate.

## Examples

### Using standalone function

```rust
use normalized_line_endings::normalized;

let input = "This is a string \n with \r some \n\r\n random newlines\r\r\n\n";
assert_eq!(
  "This is a string \n with \n some \n\n random newlines\n\n\n",
  normalized(input.chars()).collect::<String>()
);
```

### Using trait extension

```rust
use normalized_line_endings::Normalized;

let input = "This is a string \n with \r some \n\r\n random newlines\r\r\n\n";
assert_eq!(
  "This is a string \n with \n some \n\n random newlines\n\n\n",
  input.chars().normalized().collect::<String>()
);
```
